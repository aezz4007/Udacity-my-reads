This app works like a bookshelf in the read world. You can enjoy this powerful functionality
and easily add new books to your library.
This is a part of the Udacity's "Front-end Web Development Nanodegree" program. This project is an assignment for the students to pass the Nanodegree Starting
code and instructions were provided by Udacity.


## 1. Getting Started

the app has three book shelves, with the categories:
- Books I am currenty reading
- Books I want to read
- Books I already read
The app also has a search option where you can search through a variety of books.
You can search by title or author.
You can choose book category from the search page or the home page, using a drop-down menu,
that is attached to each book cover. The books then will be added to their chosen shelves.

### 1.1. Prerequisites

You need to know how to use the terminal application on your computer, and type in simple commands as described in the installation instructions. Simple knowledge of how to use your computer's web browser
is also required.

### 1.2. Installing

To use this app, you need to install and run npm packages on your computer. To do that, you need
to open the 'terminal' app on your computer. Just type in the search bar: 'terminal' or 'cmd'. 
Navigate to the app's folder.

To install <code>  npm </code>, type in the following, and then press enter:

    npm install

You'll need to wait for a few minutes for the npm packages to install, this depends on the memory and 
processor speed of your computer.
You might get some warnings in the terminal window, just ignore them. Your app will run perfectly.

Now, to run your app, just write the following command, and the app will automatically open in a new tab in your default browser.

    npm start

## 2. Deployment

Search feature is powerful. Books will appear once you start writing in the search box.
If the book is not available, your page will simply stay blank.
For the dropdown, once you click on a choice, the book jumps into the right shelf on the main page.
The book keeps its chosen state until you change it again later if you ever want to.
